# ITech-Tic-Tac-Toe-Simulator

Homework assignment from Starting out with C# 2012. Initial assignment was to create a basic windows forms simulator that would generate a random placement of tic-tac-toe values on the board and determine the winner. 

current enhancements to complete:
  1. set the code up to run through either a basic windows form or a web form.
  2. currently the entire form is filled in and then displayed along with the winner. Going to set up to display the game as the computer playing it in real time and stopping as soon as a winner is located (mostly due to the fact that in its current state it is possible for both sides to have a winning set and it just happens to declare the first combination it locates to be the winner)
